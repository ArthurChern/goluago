Library goluago aims to become a port of Lua 5.1 interpreter to Go Language Toolchain
(first 8c/6c/5c, ultimately maybe pure Go).

The library is at early stage of development (not feature complete / **not ready
for production** use), but some important goals were already completed successfully:

STATUS
------

### What works - new in alpha1 (2013-12-30):

  * [MILESTONE] workaround in ldebug.c for a bug in Go toolchain's C compiler
  * [MILESTONE][Lua] nearly all standard libraries available (with notable exception of file access)
  * [Lua] most of the Lua Testsuite test code now passes successfully
  * [API] wrapper for lua_pcall() added
  * now uses new, more complete version of the http://github.com/akavel/gostdc library

### What works since pre-alpha preview 2:

  * [MILESTONE] parsing & compiling Lua scripts to bytecode (via luaL_loadbuffer())
  * [Lua] standard libraries: basic library (print(), ipairs(), assert(), loadstring(), etc.)
  * [Lua] passes parts of the Lua testsuite (tested on fragment of "calls.lua")
  * [API] basic strings API (lua_pushlstring(), lua_tolstring())
  * [API] exposing Go funcs into Lua (lua_pushgofunction(), lua_dump())
  * [tools] Lua script for embedding Lua testsuite parts in Go unit tests (wrap-test.lua)
  * [API, Lua] string <-> number conversions

### What works since pre-alpha preview 1:

  * [API] creating/destroying new Lua state (luaL_newstate(), lua_close())
  * [API] basic integer operations on stack (lua_pushinteger(), lua_gettop(), lua_equal())
  * [API] running simple precompiled Lua code chunk (luaL_loadbuffer(), lua_call(),
    tested on precompiled chunk "return 2+3")
  * compiled and tested on: x86 (8c+8g), x64 (6c+6g), Windows/Linux
  * [tools] Lua script to simplify generation of Go+C wrappers for 
    Lua API functions (internal/gen_wrappers.lua)

Build & Testsuite Status: [![Build & Testsuite Status][2]][1]

See also: [Build & Testsuite Status][1] on Travis-CI.
Please note, that the project is still officially at early stage of development, so if
the testsuite fails, it's nothing unexpected; rather, it's very good news that *it builds*
and *big part of the testsuite does already succeed*!

WANTED / PLANS
--------------

### Crucial:

  * to fix/implement all the rest of needed C standard library functions
    (leveraging Go standard library where possible)
    -- the embedded "panicstring" calls shall emit a runtime panic when a stub function is
    called, making them easier to spot.
  * MILESTONE: enable rest of the Lua standard library
  * MILESTONE: get goluago to pass the Lua 5.1 testsuite (lua5.1-tests/*.lua)
  * MILESTONE: expose full Lua API in Go (except functions not compatible with Go)
  * ARM support, and other architectures later

### Would be nice-ies:

  * write prettier interface on top of official Lua API
    (maybe converge with http://github.com/stevedonovan/luar)
  * Lua 5.2
  * write unit tests for C standard library functions implemented for Lua;
  * improve C standard library in http://github.com/akavel/gostdc
    * maybe use some non-GPL Open Source code (FreeBSD? some stdlib for embedded systems?);
    * try to go back to non-APE version of the code, to avoid the nonstandard Lucent license
  * extract C standard library to separate package;
  * later, "ANSI C to Go translator", in extent needed by the Lua sources?

**NOTE:** you're welcome to contribute anything if you fancy, and not necessarily
from this list. The points above are mostly ideas as to what I believe would be 
most useful at this moment.


BACKGROUND INFO
---------------

### Lua?

http://lua.org

Lua is a nice scripting language. Small, written in ANSI C, highly portable,
reportedly fast. Especially popular among computer games producers, but not only.
Easily embeddable (one of its core goals), mature (Lua 1.0 ~ 1993, many applications
worldwide since then). MIT-style licensed.


### Go Language?

http://golang.org

Farly new language developed at Google. Authors are however experienced in
building and experimenting with programming languages (specifically C, Limbo), with 
notable uses, including OS development (Unix, Plan9/Inferno). Highly portable
(x86/x64, ARM; Linux/*nix, Windows, Mac OS X, other ports in progress), written
(bootstrapped) in C. BSD-style licensed. Popularity hard to determine given short
time on market, but has several nice and interesting features and properties.


INSTALLATION
------------

You need the Go language toolkit version 1 (see: http://golang.org).
With the environment properly set up, type:

    go get github.com/akavel/goluago/internal
    go test github.com/akavel/goluago/internal

To retrieve and run a sample program:

    go get github.com/akavel/goluago/testlua
    cd $GOROOT   # or, see $GOPATH; on Windows %GOROOT%, %GOPATH%
    bin/testlua  # on Windows: bin\testlua.exe
